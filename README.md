# rust-kanban-api

This is a learning project, learning to use rust to create a simple REST API

## 🤔 Summary
the idea for the first run is just:

- [x] list and create boards
- [x] list and create columns within those boards

BTW - I am using [REST Client - Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) here 👆 as a sort of quick-and-dirty Postman / Insomnia equivelent for testing. Its pretty useful 🤷‍♂️

## 🚀 Running this thing
1. Assuming you have Rust already installed 🙃
2. clone the project locally
3. `cargo run`
4. Probably should just use the VS Code Extension listed above. If not, you can just look at the [dev.http](dev.http) file to get an idea of the format of the HTTP requests.
5. Profit

## 📚 About My Learning Path So Far
I managed to do this after finishing [Ultimate Rust Crash Course | Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-rust-crash-course/) and making it maybe 50% of the way through [Ultimate Rust 2: Intermediate Concepts | Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-rust-2/) Then looking at a few tutorials / samples / and existing code. Also, to be honest GitHub Copilot helped! 😉

I plan to finish *Ultimate Rust 2* and also Rustlings, which as you can see from [my fork](https://github.com/ebetancourt/rustlings) I have gotten about half way trhough "Move Semantics"!

## ✅ TODO (Someday):
- [ ] add cards any one of those columns
- [ ] move the cards from column to column
- [ ] users
- [ ] EDITING THINGS!
- [ ] privacy
- [ ] you know, everything that would make this useful (beyond a learning project)
